# AI Code Assistant - Development with Claude

## Project Context

This document tracks the development journey of implementing an AI-powered CLI coding assistant similar to Claude Code, GeminiCLI, or opencode.

## Key Challenges to Explore

1. Agentic loop design and tool orchestration
2. Context window management and summarization
3. Safe file system and shell access
4. Streaming responses and terminal UI
5. Multi-provider LLM abstraction
6. Session persistence and history
7. Permission and safety systems

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements and Design
*Not started*

**Questions to explore:**
- What are the core vs. nice-to-have features?
- What scale are we targeting?
- What are the key technical constraints?

### Phase 2: Initial Implementation
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Implement core functionality
- Get something working end-to-end
- Validate basic assumptions

### Phase 3: Scaling and Optimization
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Add caching layer
- Optimize database queries
- Implement load balancing
- Add monitoring

### Phase 4: Polish and Documentation
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Complete documentation
- Add comprehensive tests
- Performance tuning
- Code cleanup

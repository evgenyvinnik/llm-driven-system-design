# Design AirTag - Item Tracking System

## Overview

A simplified AirTag-like platform demonstrating Bluetooth item tracking, crowd-sourced location, and the Find My network. This educational project focuses on building a privacy-preserving tracking system using billions of Apple devices as location reporters.

## Key Features

### 1. Item Tracking
- Bluetooth LE beacons
- Ultra-wideband precision
- Sound playback
- Motion detection

### 2. Find My Network
- Crowd-sourced locations
- End-to-end encryption
- Anonymous reporting
- Offline finding

### 3. Privacy Protection
- Rotating identifiers
- Anti-stalking measures
- Unknown tracker alerts
- Owner verification

### 4. Lost Mode
- Location notifications
- Contact information
- NFC tap for info
- Directions to item

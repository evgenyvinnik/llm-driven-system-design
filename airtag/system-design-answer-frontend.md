  Green ring         Gray ring           Dashed ring
  + Pulse animation  + Time label        + "?" icon
```

### Map Library Trade-off

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| ✅ Leaflet | Cross-platform, open source, extensive plugins, one codebase | Not native look, bundle size (~40KB) |
| ❌ Native MapKit | Native iOS experience, system integration, best performance | iOS only, need separate Android/web implementations |
| ❌ Google Maps | Rich features, familiar UI, Street View | Licensing costs, privacy concerns, vendor lock-in |

> "I'm choosing Leaflet because Find My needs to work across iOS, macOS, and web. While MapKit provides the best native iOS experience, we'd need three different map implementations. Leaflet gives us one codebase with consistent behavior. The react-leaflet wrapper integrates well with our React stack, and the plugin ecosystem covers our needs."

### Client-Side Decryption Architecture

**Privacy Flow:**

```
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|    AirTag         |      |   Finder iPhone   |      |   Apple Servers   |
| (broadcasts keys) |----->| (encrypts loc)    |----->| (stores blobs)    |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
                                                               |
                                                               | Encrypted
                                                               | location
                                                               | reports
                                                               v
                           +-------------------+      +-------------------+
                           |   Owner Device    |<-----|   Query by hash   |
                           | (decrypts local)  |      +-------------------+
                           +-------------------+
                                    |
                                    v
                           +-------------------+
                           |   Display on Map  |
                           +-------------------+
```

**Decryption Sequence:**

```
1. Generate period keys
   |
   +---> Master Secret + Period Number
         |
         +---> HKDF Derivation
               |
               +---> Private Key (per 15-min period)

2. Query encrypted reports
   |
   +---> Hash(Public Key) --> Server
         |
         +---> Encrypted blobs returned

3. Decrypt each report
   |
   +---> ECDH shared secret
         |
         +---> AES-GCM decrypt
               |
               +---> Latitude, Longitude, Timestamp
```

### Decryption Approach Trade-off

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| ✅ WebCrypto client-side | Privacy preserved, server never sees locations, user controls keys | Slower decryption, complex key management |
| ❌ Server-side decryption | Faster, simpler client, easier debugging | Privacy violation, single point of failure |
| ❌ Hybrid (server assists) | Balance of speed and privacy | Still exposes keys to server |

> "I'm choosing client-side decryption because privacy is the core value proposition. Users trust Find My because Apple cannot see their locations. WebCrypto API provides hardware-backed cryptography on modern devices. Yes, decryption is slower, but we can show progress UI and batch operations. The privacy guarantee is non-negotiable for this product."

### Precision Finding UI (UWB)

**Directional Interface:**

```
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|              Direction Arrow             |
|                                          |
|                   ^                      |
|                  /|\                     |
|                 / | \                    |
|                /  |  \                   |
|               /___|___\                  |
|                                          |
|           Distance: 2.3m                 |
|                                          |
|    [|||||||||||||.........]  Signal      |
|                                          |
|         "Move forward"                   |
|                                          |
|         [ Play Sound ]                   |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

**Distance-Based Feedback:**

```
Distance        Visual              Haptic              Audio
--------        ------              ------              -----
> 10m           Blue arrow          None                None
5-10m           Blue arrow          Light pulse         None
3-5m            Yellow arrow        Medium pulse        Optional
1-3m            Yellow, larger      Strong pulse        Chirp
< 1m            Green, pulsing      Continuous          Found!
```

### Precision Technology Trade-off

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| ✅ UWB (Ultra-Wideband) | Centimeter accuracy, directional, works through walls | Requires UWB hardware, higher power |
| ❌ Bluetooth RSSI | All devices support it, lower power, longer range | Meter-level accuracy, no direction |
| ❌ Bluetooth AoA/AoD | Better than RSSI, direction capable | Complex antenna arrays, not widely deployed |

> "I'm choosing UWB as the primary precision finding technology because it provides actual direction, not just proximity. Users can see an arrow pointing exactly where to go. For devices without UWB support, we fall back to Bluetooth RSSI with a simpler 'warmer/colder' interface."

### Feedback Approach Trade-off

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| ✅ Multi-sensory (Haptic + Visual + Audio) | Works in all contexts, accessibility | Battery drain, complexity |
| ❌ Audio only | Everyone hears it, simple | Social situations, noisy environments |
| ❌ Visual only | Clear, precise information | Requires screen focus |

> "I'm choosing a multi-sensory approach because users search in different contexts - a quiet office vs a loud concert venue. Haptic feedback lets you keep the phone in your pocket while walking toward the item. Visual provides precise information when you can look. Audio is optional for those who want it."

### Anti-Stalking Detection UI

**Alert Flow with Progressive Disclosure:**

```
Initial Alert (non-alarming)
      |
      v
+--------------------------------------+
| "Unknown AirTag Found"               |

| - Tap Play Sound to locate           |
|                                      |
| [How to Disable]  [Report to Police] |
+--------------------------------------+
      |
      | User taps "How to Disable"
      v
+--------------------------------------+
| Disable Unknown AirTag               |
|                                      |
| 1. Play sound to locate              |
| 2. Remove battery (twist bottom)     |
| 3. Scan with NFC for owner info      |
|                                      |
| [I Found It]  [Can't Find It]        |
+--------------------------------------+
```

**Tracker Path Visualization:**

```
+------------------------------------------------+

|          --- = Your path with tracker           |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

### Anti-Stalking UI Trade-off

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| ✅ Progressive disclosure | Reduces panic, user-controlled depth | May delay critical information |
| ❌ Full information upfront | Immediate awareness | Can cause unnecessary alarm |
| ❌ Dismissable minimal alert | Least intrusive | May be ignored, safety risk |

> "I'm choosing progressive disclosure because anti-stalking alerts have a high false positive rate - borrowed items, family members' AirTags, etc. Showing 'STALKER DETECTED' causes panic when it's often a false alarm. By starting with neutral language and letting users drill down, we give control without causing unnecessary fear."

### State Management

**Store Structure:**

```
FindMyStore
|
+-- devices: Map<deviceId, Device>
|   +-- id, name, emoji, lostMode
|
+-- locations: Map<deviceId, Location[]>
|   +-- latitude, longitude, timestamp, accuracy
|
+-- selectedDeviceId: string | null
|
+-- notifications: Notification[]
|   +-- type: "found" | "tracker_alert" | "low_battery"
|   +-- isRead: boolean
|
+-- ui
|   +-- isDecrypting: boolean
|   +-- decryptionProgress: number (0-100)
|   +-- isOffline: boolean
|
+-- actions
    +-- selectDevice(id)
    +-- refreshDevices()
    +-- fetchLocations(deviceId, timeRange)
    +-- markNotificationRead(id)
```

### State Management Trade-off

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| ✅ Zustand | Simple API, less boilerplate, small bundle | Less ecosystem |
| ❌ Redux + RTK | Mature ecosystem, middleware, time-travel debugging | Verbose, larger bundle |
| ❌ React Context | No dependencies, built-in | Performance issues with frequent updates |

> "I'm choosing Zustand because Find My has moderate state complexity - a dozen devices, their locations, and UI state. Redux would add boilerplate without proportional benefit. The store is easy to test and if we grow to hundreds of devices, we can migrate."

### Offline Strategy Trade-off

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| ✅ Service Worker + IndexedDB | Works offline, fine-grained control, background sync | Complex to debug, cache invalidation |
| ❌ localStorage only | Simple, synchronous | 5MB limit, no asset caching |
| ❌ No offline support | Simpler implementation | Useless when you need it most |

> "I'm choosing Service Worker caching because offline support is critical for Find My. Users often search for lost items in areas with poor connectivity - basements, rural areas. The cache-then-network strategy ensures the app works immediately. This is exactly the scenario where offline matters most."

### Auto-Refresh Strategy

**Polling Approach:**

```
+------------------+
| App in Foreground|
+------------------+
        |
        v
+------------------+
| Start 60s Timer  |
+------------------+
        |
        | (60 seconds)
        v
+------------------+       +------------------+
| Fetch New        |------>| Decrypt New      |
| Reports          |       | Locations        |
+------------------+       +------------------+
        |                          |
        v                          v
+------------------+       +------------------+
| Merge with       |       | Update Map       |
| Existing         |       | Markers          |
+------------------+       +------------------+
        |
        | (repeat)
        v
+------------------+
| Wait 60s         |
+------------------+
```

### Refresh Interval Trade-off

| Interval | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| ✅ 60 seconds | Balanced freshness, reasonable battery, matches broadcast | May feel slow |
| ❌ 10 seconds | Near real-time | Battery drain, excessive API calls |
| ❌ 5 minutes | Low battery/network use | Frustrating when actively searching |

> "I'm choosing 60 seconds because it matches AirTag's broadcast cycle. The tracker rotates keys every 15 minutes and broadcasts continuously, but finder devices batch reports. Refreshing faster than 60 seconds rarely yields new data. When actively precision finding, we switch to continuous UWB ranging which is real-time."

## 📊 Trade-offs Summary

| Decision | Chosen | Alternative | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Map library | ✅ Leaflet | ❌ Native MapKit | Cross-platform, single codebase |
| Decryption | ✅ WebCrypto client-side | ❌ Server-side | Privacy preservation is core |
| State management | ✅ Zustand | ❌ Redux | Simpler for moderate complexity |
| Precision finding | ✅ UWB primary | ❌ Bluetooth only | Directional guidance matters |
| Anti-stalking UI | ✅ Progressive disclosure | ❌ Full info upfront | Reduce false alarm panic |
| Offline support | ✅ Service Worker | ❌ None | Critical for lost device scenarios |
| Refresh interval | ✅ 60 seconds | ❌ 10 seconds | Matches broadcast cycle, battery |
| Haptic feedback | ✅ Distance-based patterns | ❌ None | Multi-sensory guidance |

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

With more time I'd add AR precision finding (a camera overlay with a directional arrow), a home-screen widget for at-a-glance device status, a family-sharing UI with per-device permission controls, and a history-playback scrubber to replay a device's movement. Longer term: a full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit, system-aware dark mode with map-style switching, and ML-driven "likely at home/work" location hints.

## 💡 Summary

The through-line of this frontend: **client-side decryption keeps the server blind, progressive disclosure keeps the anti-stalking flow calm, and offline support works precisely when a device is lost and the network isn't there.** Leaflet gives one cross-platform map, WebCrypto does hardware-backed decryption in the owner's session, Zustand keeps state pragmatic, and UWB-with-Bluetooth-fallback drives precision finding. The hardest judgment call is the anti-stalking UI — surfacing a real threat without triggering panic over a friend's tag riding along — which progressive disclosure solves by letting users reveal detail at their own pace.

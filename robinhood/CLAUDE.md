# Robinhood - Stock Trading - Development with Claude

## Project Context

This document tracks the development journey of implementing A stock trading platform with real-time quotes.

## Key Challenges to Explore

1. Real-time data feeds
2. Order matching
3. Transaction integrity
4. Market data distribution

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements and Design
*Completed*

**Decisions made:**
- Core features: real-time quotes, order placement, portfolio tracking, watchlists, price alerts
- Scale: learning project, local development with simulated data
- Tech stack: Node.js + Express + WebSocket (backend), React + Vite + Tanstack Router + Zustand (frontend), PostgreSQL + Redis (storage)

### Phase 2: Initial Implementation
*In progress*

**Completed:**
- Backend API with Express and WebSocket
- Real-time quote simulation with configurable volatility
- Order placement and execution simulation
- Portfolio tracking with P&L calculations
- Watchlists and price alerts
- Frontend with portfolio, stock detail, orders, and watchlist views
- Session-based authentication

**Focus areas:**
- Implement core functionality
- Get something working end-to-end
- Validate basic assumptions

### Phase 3: Scaling and Optimization
